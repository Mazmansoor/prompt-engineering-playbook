# Prompt Engineering Playbook

Prompt engineering is not about clever wording.
It is about **structured intent**.

At its core, a prompt is an interface between human judgment
and machine execution.

This playbook exists to teach that interface—
clearly, rigorously, and without hype.

## What You’ll Learn Here

- How to design prompts that are **reliable, testable, and adaptable**
- Why most prompts fail—and how to diagnose them
- How constraints, context, and evaluation shape outcomes
- How to think in patterns instead of tricks

## What This Is Not

- A prompt dump  
- A collection of viral hacks  
- Model-specific folklore  

This is a **field manual**.
Built for learners, builders, educators, and skeptics.

## How to Use This Playbook

1. Start with **Foundations** — understand the mental model  
2. Study **Patterns** — reusable structures, not recipes  
3. Practice in **Labs** — rewrite, debug, compare  
4. Explore **Advanced** — agents, tools, failure modes  
5. Reflect in **Philosophy** — ethics, power, responsibility  

Clarity compounds.
