## Why This Playbook Exists

Prompt engineering is an operations discipline. You are configuring behavior, risk, and user experience—not asking questions. This playbook is a premium, narrative-first guide that treats prompts like designed products.

**What you can expect:** clarity, structure, and ready-to-ship templates that work across models.

## Premium Standards

<span class="section-label">Quality Proof Points</span>

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Experience-first layout.</strong> Custom navigation, sticky headers, and consistent typography keep the playbook feeling like a premium product instead of a repo.</li>
  <li><strong>Operational checklists.</strong> Each core pattern pairs templates with shipping and quality checklists so teams have a clear definition of done.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety cues everywhere.</strong> Prompts call for refusals, confidence, and missing-data handling to prevent silent failures.</li>
  <li><strong>Client-friendly framing.</strong> Lede copy, CTAs, and section intros explain value in business language for decision-makers.</li>
</ul>

## Navigate the Playbook

### Foundations — Build the Mental Model

- [What Is a Prompt?](foundations/01-what-is-a-prompt): Understand prompts as configurations, not messages.
- [Prompt Style Guide](foundations/prompt-style-guide): Codify naming, constraints, structure, and evaluation.

### Patterns — Reusable Shapes

- [Structured Outputs](patterns/01-structured-outputs): Force consistency with schemas, tables, and parsers.

### Advanced — Push the Edge

- [Tool-Using Prompts](advanced/01-tool-use): Specify manifests, decision policies, and failure handling.

### Labs — Practice with Guardrails

- [Debugging Lab](labs/01-debugging-lab): Run a guided loop to diagnose and harden weak prompts.

### Real-World — Production Templates

- [Support Triage](real-world/01-support-triage): Classify, escalate, and log rationales for compliance.

### Philosophy — Stay Responsible

- [Ethics](philosophy/01-ethics): Treat prompting as a safety-critical design surface.

## How to Get the Most Value

1. **Start with the mental model.** Align your team on the five-part prompt skeleton.
2. **Adopt patterns as primitives.** Use structured outputs and constraints before adding complexity.
3. **Practice in labs.** Iterate with evaluation criteria baked into your prompts.
4. **Operationalize.** Pair prompts with metrics, redaction, and audit trails before launch.
5. **Revisit regularly.** This is a living playbook—update your standards as your products evolve.

## Premium Experience, No Distractions

This site is built to feel like a product, not a repository. No "view source" clutter—just focused guidance ready for clients, stakeholders, and production teams.

## Award-Worthy Next Additions

To turn this into a showcase-ready, award-winning playbook, prioritize:

- **Live demos:** Embed interactive labs or short Loom walkthroughs that demonstrate prompts succeeding and failing.
- **Case studies:** Publish 2–3 anonymized deployments with measurable impact, constraints, and governance notes.
- **Accessibility polish:** Add ARIA labels, focus states, and a readable light mode to meet AA guidelines.
- **Evaluation harness:** Provide a small benchmark suite or notebooks showing how to score prompts over time.
