# Prompt Engineering Playbook

A practical, teaching-first guide to prompt engineering.

This repository treats prompts as **designed systems**—
not magic spells, not hacks.

## Structure

- `/foundations` — mental models and first principles  
- `/patterns` — reusable prompt structures  
- `/advanced` — agentic, tool-using, and complex prompts  
- `/labs` — exercises and prompt debugging  
- `/real-world` — applied use cases  
- `/philosophy` — ethics, power, and responsibility  

## Design Principles

- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- Show failures, not just successes
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Teach transferable thinking

## Who This Is For

- Developers building AI-powered systems  
- Educators teaching AI literacy  
- Strategists and analysts  
- Anyone who wants reliable outcomes from language models  

## Status

This is a living playbook.
Stable ideas over novelty.

Contributions are welcome—if they add clarity.
