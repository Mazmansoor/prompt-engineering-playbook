# Prompt Engineering Playbook

Premium-grade, teaching-first guidance for designing prompt systems that hold up in production.

The playbook treats prompts as **designed control surfaces**—not magic spells. Every page is built for clarity, rigor, and client-ready polish.

## Structure

- `/foundations` — mental models and first principles
- `/patterns` — reusable prompt structures (e.g., structured outputs)
- `/advanced` — agentic, tool-using, and complex prompts
- `/labs` — exercises and prompt debugging
- `/real-world` — applied use cases
- `/philosophy` — ethics, power, and responsibility

## Design Principles

- Explain *why*, not just *what*
- Show failures, not just successes
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Teach transferable thinking
- Keep presentation premium and client-ready

## Who This Is For

- Builders of AI-powered products who need predictable results
- Educators teaching responsible prompt design
- Analysts and strategists defining policy and governance
- Teams preparing prompts for regulated or high-stakes workflows

## Status

This is a living playbook. Stable ideas over novelty. Updates prioritize polish, operational rigor, and ethical clarity.

## Local Preview

Use the built-in Jekyll support to preview the premium layout locally:

1. Install Ruby and Bundler.
2. Run `bundle install` to fetch dependencies.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open `http://localhost:4000`.

If Jekyll is unavailable in your environment, you can still browse the markdown directly—every page is designed to read cleanly without the theme.

## Quickstart

1. Read `/foundations/01-what-is-a-prompt.md` to align on the five-part prompt skeleton.
2. Apply a reusable pattern from `/patterns` to reduce variance.
3. Stress-test it with a scenario in `/labs` and document failure modes.
4. Add guardrails from `/advanced` (tool policies, budgets, fallbacks) before shipping.
5. Review the ethical checklist in `/philosophy` to keep outcomes responsible.

## Awards-Ready Backlog

To push this from polished to prize-worthy, add:

- **Interactive labs** with runnable examples or short walkthrough clips.
- **Before/after case studies** showing measurable lift from adopting the patterns.
- **Accessibility pass** (ARIA labels, focus states, light/dark toggle) to meet AA standards.
- **Evaluation harness** with sample test sets, scoring scripts, and guidance for regression checks.
