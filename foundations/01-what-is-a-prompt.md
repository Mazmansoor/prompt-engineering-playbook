# What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is not a question.
A prompt is not a command.
A prompt is not text.

A prompt is a **control surface**.

It shapes:
- What the system attends to
- How it reasons
- What it excludes
- How it evaluates success

## The Core Misunderstanding

Most people treat prompts as messages.
In reality, prompts are **configurations**.

They configure:
- Role
- Context
- Constraints
- Output format
- Evaluation criteria

## A Minimal Prompt Skeleton

Every effective prompt answers five questions:

1. Who is the system acting as?
2. What is the task?
3. What context matters?
4. What constraints apply?
5. What does success look like?

Miss one—and failure becomes likely.

## Key Insight

Prompt engineering is not about language.
It is about **intent made explicit**.
