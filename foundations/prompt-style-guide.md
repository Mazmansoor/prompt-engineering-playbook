# Prompt Style Guide

## Prefer Explicit Roles
Bad: “Write an analysis.”  
Better: “Act as a policy analyst evaluating…”

## Declare Constraints Early
Length, format, assumptions, uncertainty.

## Separate Task from Context
Do not bury instructions inside background text.

## Force Structure in Outputs
Lists, tables, sections reduce ambiguity.

## Anticipate Failure
Ask for uncertainty, limits, and alternatives.

Clarity is kindness—to the model and the reader.
